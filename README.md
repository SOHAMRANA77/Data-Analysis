## Data
The dataset used in this project contains weather information, including date/time, temperature, weather condition, wind speed, visibility, and more. The data is sourced from [kaggle](www.kaggle.com).

## Analysis
The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- Visualization of weather patterns and trends.
- Calculating statistics based on weather conditions.
## Pandas:

- **`import pandas as pd`**: Importing the Pandas library, a fundamental tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
- **`pd.read_csv()`**: Reading and importing CSV files, allowing access to tabular data.
- **`.shape`**: Obtaining the dimensions of the dataset, revealing the total number of rows and columns present.
- **`df.isnull().sum()`**: Identifying and quantifying missing values within each column of the DataFrame, a crucial step in data preprocessing.
- **`.fillna()`**: Imputing null values within a column by replacing them with specified values, ensuring data completeness and accuracy.
- **`value_counts()`**: Presenting a count of unique values within a specific column, offering valuable insights into the distribution of categorical data.
- **`isin()`**: Filtering and displaying records that match specified elements, aiding in targeted data exploration.
- **`apply()`**: Executing a function along a given axis of the DataFrame, facilitating the application of customized operations for advanced data processing and transformation.
- **`.head()`**: Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
- **`.index`**: Viewing the index of the DataFrame.
- **`.columns`**: Displaying the column names.
- **`dtypes`**: Getting the data types of each column.
- **`.unique()`**: Finding unique values in a column.
- **`.nunique()`**: Counting the number of unique values in a column.
- **`count()`**: Counting non-null entries in each column.
- **`value_counts()`**: Counting occurrences of unique values in a column.
- **`info()`**: Displaying concise information about the DataFrame.
- **`.rename()`**: Renaming a column.
- **`.mean()`, `.min()`, `.max()`, `.std()`**: Calculating mean, min, max, and standard deviation for specific columns.
- **`.groupby()`**: Grouping data based on a column.
- **`Boolean indexing`**: Selecting rows based on specific conditions.

## Matplotlib:

- **`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`**: Importing Matplotlib, a powerful plotting library in Python.
- **`plt.plot()`**: Creating line plots to visualize data trends.
- **`plt.scatter()`**: Creating scatter plots to display relationships between variables.
- **`plt.bar()`**: Constructing bar plots to compare categorical data.
- **`plt.hist()`**: Generating histograms for analyzing data distributions.
- **`plt.boxplot()`**: Creating boxplots to identify outliers and quartiles.
- **`plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()`, `plt.title()`**: Adding labels and titles to the plot for better interpretation.
- **`plt.legend()`**: Adding legends to the plot for clarity.
- **`plt.show()`**: Displaying the plot.

## Seaborn:

- **`import seaborn as sns`**: Importing Seaborn, a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **`sns.set()`**: Setting aesthetic parameters in one step.
- **`sns.countplot()`**: Creating count plots to show the counts of observations in each category.
- **`sns.heatmap()`**: Generating heatmaps to visualize data in a 2D form.
- **`sns.pairplot()`**: Constructing pair plots for pairwise relationships across an entire dataframe.
- **`sns.distplot()`**: Plotting univariate distributions, useful for examining probability distributions.
- **`sns.boxplot()`**: Creating box plots to display the distribution of categorical data.
- **`sns.lmplot()`**: Plotting data and regression models to understand the relationship between variables.

3. Open and run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to perform the data analysis.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains weather information, including date/time, temperature, weather condition, wind speed, visibility, and more. The data is sourced from [kaggle](www.kaggle.com).

## Analysis
The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- Visualization of weather patterns and trends.
- Calculating statistics based on weather conditions.
### Key Pandas Operations
- **`import pandas as pd`**: Utilized to import the Pandas library, a fundamental tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
- **`pd.read_csv`**: Employed to read and import CSV files within the Jupyter notebook, enabling seamless access to tabular data.
- **`.shape`**: Get the dimensions of the dataset, revealing the total number of rows and columns present.
- **`df.isnull().sum()`**: Apply to identify and quantify missing values within each column of the DataFrame, a crucial step in data preprocessing.
- **`fillna()`**: Utilized to impute null values within a column by replacing them with specified values, ensuring data completeness and accuracy.
- **`value_counts`**: Leveraged to present a count of unique values within a specific column, offering valuable insights into the distribution of categorical data.
- **`isin()`**: Applied to filter and display records that match specified elements, aiding in targeted data exploration.
- **`apply()`**: Utilized to execute a function along a given axis of the DataFrame, facilitating the application of customized operations for advanced data processing and transformation.
- **`read_csv`**: Load data from a CSV file.
- **`.head()`**: Display the first few rows of the dataset.
- **`.index`**: View the index of the DataFrame.
- **`.columns`**: Display the column names.
- **`dtypes`**: Get the data types of each column.
- **`.unique()`**: Find unique values in a column.
- **`.nunique()`**: Count the number of unique values in a column.
- **`count()`**: Count non-null entries in each column.
- **`value_counts()`**: Count occurrences of unique values in a column.
- **`info()`**: Display concise information about the DataFrame.
- **`.rename()`**: Rename a column.
- **`.mean()`, `.min()`, `.max()`, `.std()`**: Calculate mean, min, max, and standard deviation for specific columns.
- **`.groupby()`**: Group data based on a column.
- **`Boolean indexing`**: Select rows based on specific conditions.

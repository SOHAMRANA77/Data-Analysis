1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages as mentioned in the installation section.
3. Open and run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to perform the data analysis.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains weather information, including date/time, temperature, weather condition, wind speed, visibility, and more. The data is sourced from [kaggle](www.kaggle.com).

## Analysis
The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- Visualization of weather patterns and trends.
- Calculating statistics based on weather conditions.
### Key Pandas Operations
- read_csv: Load data from a CSV file.
- .head(): Display the first few rows of the dataset.
- .shape: Get the dimensions (rows, columns) of the dataset.
- .index: View the index of the DataFrame.
- .columns: Display the column names.
- dtypes: Get the data types of each column.
- .unique(): Find unique values in a column.
- .nunique(): Count the number of unique values in a column.
- count(): Count non-null entries in each column.
- value_counts(): Count occurrences of unique values in a column.
- info(): Display concise information about the DataFrame.
- .isnull().sum(): Count missing (null) values in each column.
- .rename(): Rename a column.
- .mean(), .min(), .max(), .std(): Calculate mean, min, max, and standard deviation for specific columns.
- .groupby(): Group data based on a column.
- Boolean indexing: Select rows based on specific conditions.
